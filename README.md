Descriptionâ€”This chatbot helps users search the top books on any subject and get recipes for any food they want to know.
This tool is made for students living in PGs and hostels, who love to read books for learning.

I used HTML, CSS for the front end and node, and JavaScript for the backend.

This chatbot helps students to easily choose books from multiple choices available in the market and easy recipes with only
required ingredients and optional ingredients to enhance the taste of food.

I used the Gemini API key from google AI-studio for it
